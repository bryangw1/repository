# about
Hi! I‚Äôm Bryan, Legal Engineer, Technology Researcher, and Consultant based in Kansas City, Missouri.

Going back to 2015, I have been working on projects related to AI, Blockchain, and Data Governance. Some of the things I am most proud of recently include a draft paper I co-authored a paper on LLMs and Law -[A Path Toward Legal Autonomy: An interoperable and explainable approach to extracting, transforming, loading and computing legal information using large language models, expert systems and Bayesian networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18537) - and my work on security tokens at [Upside](https://www.upside.gg/), including the [Republic Note Token](https://republic.com/note)(a tokenized VC fund) and [The Vic at Sunterra](https://republic.com/the-vic-at-sunterra)(a tokenized apartment complex). In my spare time, I have also been serving as the Founding Editor in Chief for the [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/) and an affiliated researcher with the [MIT Connection Science Research Group](https://connection.mit.edu/), under the direction of [Sandy Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/), since 2019.

My background is in law. I went to law school at [UMKC](https://law.umkc.edu/), I passed the bar in Missouri, and I am currently an inactive attorney. One of the things I started to realize during law school is that the effective use of new technologies demands thinking about law and legal processes in a new way, higher up the funnel, as a more integrated part of the design process (and less like a parallel path that hopefully meets back together later).
