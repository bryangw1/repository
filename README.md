# ‚ÑπÔ∏è about
Hi! I‚Äôm Bryan, Legal Engineer, Technology Researcher, and Consultant based in Kansas City, Missouri. Going back to 2015, I have been working on projects related to AI, Blockchain, and Data Governance.

Recently, I've been studying AI ([A Path Toward Legal Autonomy: An interoperable and explainable approach to extracting, transforming, loading and computing legal information using large language models, expert systems and Bayesian networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18537)) and doing a lot of work on security tokens and tokenized real world assets (including for the [Republic Note Token](https://republic.com/note)(a tokenized VC fund) and [The Vic at Sunterra](https://republic.com/the-vic-at-sunterra)(a tokenized apartment complex)).

In my spare time, I have also been serving as the Founding Editor in Chief for the [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu/) and an affiliated researcher with the [MIT Connection Science Research Group](https://connection.mit.edu/), under the direction of [Sandy Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/), since 2019.

## legal engineering
One of the things I started to realize during law school is that the effective use of new technologies demands thinking about law and legal processes in a new way, higher up the funnel, as a more integrated part of the design process (and less like a parallel path that hopefully meets back together later). In this way, the law is something that can be engineered to achieve a specific set of goals, defined by different parameters, and using objective, measurable criteria. In my tokenization work, including as a Legal Engineer at Upside, I help security token issuers troubleshoot legal, compliance, and regulatory issues in the contexts of product design, project management, and customer education. Previously, I have undertaken similar work at [Brighthive](https://www.brighthive.io/) ‚Äì a startup building out AI-enabled Data Governance solutions ‚Äì and [RiskGenius](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/riskgenius) ‚Äì a startup that created tools using numerous AI techniques to review, automate, and draft insurance policies that was acquired by [Bold Penguin](https://www.boldpenguin.com/) in 2019.

## research
In my capacity for research, I am the Founding Editor in Chief of the MIT Computational Law Report, an agile, new media online publication that explores the ways that law and legal processes can be reimagined and engineered as computational systems. In this role, I coordinate the management and review of articles and other content published. Since 2019, we have received over 200,000+ organic page views. Additionally, I have worked as an adjunct professor, colleague instructor, and co-instructor for classes including [Santa Barbara & Ventura Colleges of Law](https://www.collegesoflaw.edu/) [Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Computational Law](https://github.com/bryangw1/repository/blob/master/archive/MA534%20Representing%20Law%20in%20Code.pdf), the [MIT Media Lab‚Äôs AI for Impact course](https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/MAS/fa20/MAS.665/), and for the [MIT Media Lab's IAP Computational Law Workshop Course](https://law.mit.edu/pub/2024-iap-workshop/).

My research projects have been featured at [Imagination in Action by Forbes](https://www.imaginationinaction.co/), the [UN World Data Forum](https://youtu.be/1iDmSXJwClA?feature=shared&t=2875), the [New York Stock Exchange](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KqIrByHnhE1nRU8ASibSCWEwIHpp_7ABgP2-DNR838I/edit?usp=sharing), and at the [World Economic Forum in Davos](https://law.mit.edu/pub/cldgsattheworldeconomicforum/release/2), as well as in notable law review articles and other academic publications.

## consulting
In my capacity for consulting, I have worked on a number of grant funded projects, including for the [American Bar Association Center for Innovation](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/centers_commissions/center-for-innovation/), [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.org/), the [Kauffman Foundation](https://www.kauffman.org/), [Pathcheck Foundation](https://www.pathcheck.org/), [Consumer Reports](https://innovation.consumerreports.org/)and [Relativity](https://www.relativity.com/). My work on these projects has been featured in the Stanford Social Innovation Review and earned me the designation of one of [eighteen millenials changing the face of Legal Tech](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2018/03/13/18-millennials-changing-the-face-of-legal-tech/?slreturn=20240428193605) by Law.com‚Äôs [LegalTech News](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/?slreturn=20240428193626).
